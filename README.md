This is very much a work in progress. I've made several files and attached them here.  This work was inspired by difl's work on thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3310883. 

Because many maker spaces have smaller 3d printers, I've remodelled and scaled down all the prints to 73% of difl's.

I'm working out file hosting, but because the files aren't great yet, please email me everjay[at]uw.edu and i'll share files!
